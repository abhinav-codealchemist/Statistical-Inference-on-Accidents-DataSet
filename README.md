# Statistical Inference on "Accidents" DataSet

Statistical Inference on "Accidents" DataSet, hosted on the OpenDataBCN Website.

I considered a dataset of accidents in Barcelona in 2013. This dataset can be downloaded from the OpenDataBCN website, Barcelona City Hallâ€™s open data service. Each register in the dataset represents an accident via a series of features: weekday, hour, address, number of dead and injured people, etc. This dataset will represent our population: the set of all reported traffic accidents in Barcelona during 2013.
